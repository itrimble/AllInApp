# RSS Feed Processing
feedparser               # Used for fetching and parsing RSS feeds (e.g., for podcast episodes).

# Audio Processing
pydub                    # Helps in manipulating audio files (e.g., converting, slicing, adjusting volume).

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
spacy                    # Industrial-strength NLP library; used for tokenization, POS tagging, NER, etc.
# To use spaCy effectively, a language model is often needed, e.g.:
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
pytextrank               # A Python implementation of TextRank for text summarization and keyword extraction, often used with spaCy.
sentence-transformers    # Provides easy ways to compute embeddings (vector representations) for sentences & paragraphs. Used for semantic similarity tasks.
faiss-cpu                # Library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. 'cpu' version for CPU-only support.
transformers             # State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. Provides models like BERT, GPT-2 (e.g. for text generation or analysis).
                         # Comment "For GPT-Neo and BART" seems specific to how it might be used in this project.

# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Core
torch                    # A fundamental tensor library for deep learning, used by many other ML libraries (transformers, diffusers, TTS).

# Text-to-Speech (TTS)
TTS                      # Library for advanced text-to-speech generation. (Likely Mozilla TTS or Coqui TTS).

# Image Generation (Show Art)
diffusers                # Library for state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for image generation.
accelerate               # A PyTorch library that simplifies running PyTorch code on any kind of distributed setup (multi-GPU, TPU, etc.), often a helper for `diffusers`.

# RSS Feed Generation (if the app also creates feeds)
feedgen                  # Used to generate RSS or Atom feeds.

# Configuration Management
python-dotenv            # Reads key-value pairs from a .env file and sets them as environment variables.

# HTTP Requests
requests                 # Simple and elegant HTTP library for Python, used for making web requests (e.g., downloading files).

# Numerical Operations
numpy                    # Fundamental package for numerical computation in Python; prerequisite for many scientific libraries.

# Model File Handling
safetensors              # A new simple format for storing tensors safely (especially for large models), used by Hugging Face.

# Rich CLI User Interface
rich                     # Library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal, used here for progress bars and enhanced CLI output.
